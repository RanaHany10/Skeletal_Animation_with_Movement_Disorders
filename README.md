# Skeletal Animation of Human Normal Motion Patterns and Movement Disorders Using 3D Modeling in Blender

## Overview
This project focuses on the skeletal animation of human motion patterns, specifically targeting both normal movements and movement disorders such as Diplegic Gait and Circumduction Gait. Utilizing Blender for 3D modeling and animation, along with motion capture data, we aim to create realistic simulations that can be used for both educational and clinical purposes.

## Features
- **3D Skeletal Modeling:** Create detailed skeletal models of human figures.
- **Motion Pattern Simulation:** Animate normal and abnormal human motion patterns, including Diplegic and Circumduction Gait.
- **Gait Analysis:** Analyze and visualize different gait patterns to understand movement disorders.
- **Video Presentation:** Compile animations into video presentations for easy viewing and analysis.

## Technologies Used

### Blender
Blender is a powerful open-source 3D creation suite that supports the entirety of the 3D pipelineâ€”modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing, and motion tracking. In this project, Blender is utilized for:
- **3D Modeling:** Creating detailed skeletal structures and human models that represent both normal and abnormal gait patterns.
- **Animation:** Keyframing and animating the movement of these models to accurately depict various gait types, including normal, Diplegic Gait, and Circumduction Gait.
- **Rendering:** Generating high-quality visuals and videos of the animations, which can be used for analysis or presentations.


### Motion Capture Data
To accurately model and animate human motion patterns.

### Video Editing Software
For creating the final video presentations of the animations.

## Installation
